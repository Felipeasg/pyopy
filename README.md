# Installation

## Requirements

### Octave and the requirements or matlab and the requirements
### As for python: oct2py, numpy, scipy
### HCTSA: symlink or copy to blah

## Linux 64

Installation in linux 64 and Matlab/Octave compatibility state:

  MEXing:
     - mex fails with the TSTool, the rest seem to be alright
       It is explicitly said it won't work with octave
         http://www.physik3.gwdg.de/tstool/HTML/node84.html
      But octave has made good progress on OO support, so I started giving it a try
      Not too seriously and unsuccessful after 1 hour,
      see TSTOOL-octave.tar.gz saved somewhere if ever we feel like keeping going on

  Notes on some of the missing toolboxes:
    - Octave misses a (compatible) Curve Fitting Toolbox
      See: http://www.krizka.net/2010/11/01/non-linear-fitting-using-gnuoctave-and-leasqr/
